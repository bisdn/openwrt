[Introduction]
	This package offers the event button driver for Hawkeye platform with
IRQ-based button design.

[Device Tree Bindings]
	Required properties:
	- compatible     : Should be "hawkeye,irq-buttons"

	Each event button is represented as a sub-node of the irq-button device.
	Each node's name represents the name of the corresponding LED.

	Event button sub-node properties:
	- interrupts     : Interrupt specification for event button.


	Example:
	
	irq-buttons {
		compatible = "hawkeye,irq-buttons";
		event1 {
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		};
		power {
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		};
	};

[Driver Building and Usage]
	# make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- KDIR=/flexbuild/build/linux/linux/arm64/output/
	# insmod event_button.ko

[Usage]
	The driver provides two sysfs nodes for each event button under /sys/class/misc/event_button:

	trigger - Read only. To get number of times event button has been triggered.
	clean   - Write only. To clean trigger times of event button.


	Example:

	To get number of times "event1" button has bee triggered,
	# cat /sys/class/misc/event_button/event1_trigger

	To clean trigger times of "event1" button,
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/misc/event_button/event1_clean
